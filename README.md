# PROJECT-2

## Description

This project is a simple Python "Guess the Number" game. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. After each guess, the program will guide the player by indicating whether the correct number is higher or lower. The game continues until the player guesses the number correctly, and then displays the total number of attempts taken.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the code from `main.py` (or the relevant Python file).
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to guess the number.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- User input for guesses
- Hints after each guess (higher/lower)

## Example Output
